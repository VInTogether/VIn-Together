                    <ul>
                        <li>From this module and port programming in the module 4 where you can expect debugging type of questions Where they will give some code and ask you to correct the code if there are any mistakes.  </li>
                        <li>If you don't understand coding part in this, just mug up or remember the model codes (only 3 or 4 codes are there) just get to  Know where to change values.(again calculating values is easier) </li>
                        <li>the code for time delay using loops is almost same (just you need to plugin the values ) two types are there just get to ' 

                            Know when to use what and calculation of time delay for the given code is easiest part of this module 
                            
                             </li>
                        <li>from stack learn how to move values between different register banks (again for this also the basic code structure remains same just you need to know what is psw value for particular register bank and you just need to change registers) </li>
                        <li>addressing models learn the theory part and syntax for addressing modes 

                        </li>
                        <li>one important type of question is movement values from ROM to RAM (this includes use of instructions like MOVC,MOVX instructions)(again here also the code structure remains same you just need to change values according to question) 

                            Questions on this may look like this (this one of the previous cat question) 
                            
                            Assume "your name" is stored in the code memory in 
                            
                            hexadecimal number system. Write an 8051 assembly language 
                            
                            program to transfer "your name" from code memory to data 
                            
                            memory. Assume the source and destination address as required. 
                            
                             </li>
                        <li>when it comes to arithimetic operations they may ask you to add the values stored at particular memory location or they will give some numbers(here also the code almost remains same you just need to change values) and asks you to write the code to add them or sometimes they will give some expression and ask you to write code to solve that. </li>     

                    </ul>
