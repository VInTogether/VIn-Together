                    <ul>
                        <li>For an average/below average student learn all the theory concepts properly with some example codes. Mainly focus on loops and conditionals(with some basic examples and flowcharts) and learn theory from type conversions.</li>
                        <li>Possibility of coding questions like swap two numbers without temporary variable and solving the quadratic equations using discriminant.</li>
                        <li>The coding questions from this module won't be tricky just read question properly you will get to know what to do (if you don't know what to do write the basic code structure).</li>
                        <li>As the code logic is different for different students it's better if you write explanation of the code(like what you are doing in the code) only if you have time.</li>
                        <li>Write sample input and output for every code (this carries some marks).</li>
