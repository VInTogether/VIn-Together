                    <h3>Points to remember:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The definition of an array.</li>
                        <li>The advantages of the array (e.g., no need to maintain separate variables for all the elements; with a single variable name, we can access many values).</li>
                        <li>How array addressing works.</li>
                        <li>Taking input of the array elements (most of the time, we use a for loop to take inputs) and accessing array elements (array indexing) and the coding part related to arrays.</li>
                        <li>Array indexing starts from 0 to length - 1. Array indexing in a two-dimensional array is very important (sometimes the array can use row-based indexing or column-based indexing; learn both).</li>
                        <li>Sometimes, they may give code and ask you the output of the code.</li>
                        <li>In a two-dimensional array, there may be standard questions like matrix addition or matrix multiplication (but for any code, the way of taking input is the same; at least learn that).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="remarks">
                    <h3>Types of Questions:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mostly, questions from this topic will be coding questions where they will provide some simple logic-based problems (for almost all questions, taking input for the array is a part, so remember at least how to take inputs).</li>
                        <li>The coding questions that come may be a mix of if statements, for loops, and arrays.</li>
                        <li>In a two-dimensional array, there may be a possibility of asking standard questions like matrix addition or matrix multiplication (but for any code, the way of taking input is the same, so at least learn that).</li>
                        <li>In a 2D array, there is a possibility that they will give the starting address and ask for the address of some element in the array where they provide the index of the locations.</li>
