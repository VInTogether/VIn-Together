                    <h3>Points to remember:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>From this part, we can expect theory questions.</li>
                        <li>Definition and advantages of functions.</li>
                        <li>The main difference between function call by reference and call by value.</li>
                        <li>There are some other types of functions, like the classification of functions based on return type and parameters.</li>
                        <li>There is something called inline functions; remember its definition and advantages.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Types of Questions:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sometimes, they directly ask the difference between call by reference and call by value with examples.</li>
                        <li>They may give some code that has both call by reference and call by value parameters in a function, ask what the values of the parameters are after the function is called, and ask you to explain (this is again about call by reference and call by value).</li>
                        <li>There may be a possibility of asking recursive function questions, like Fibonacci series, factorial, or the sum of n numbers.</li>
                        <li>There is a possibility of questions where they provide some mathematical function and ask you to write a function for that.</li>
                    </ol>
