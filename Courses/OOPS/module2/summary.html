                        <li>If you limit your capabilities to being an average or below-average student, focus on learning the theory of functions and storage classes, along with basic coding skills, such as taking inputs for strings and arrays and writing code for standard string operations.</li>
                        <li>If you want good marks from this module, you need to practice the coding part of arrays and strings, which includes using for loops and if statements. (The questions in the exam won't be very tough, but you will need to spend some time thinking about them.)</li>
